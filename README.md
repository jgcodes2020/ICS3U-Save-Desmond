# "Save Desmond"

This game was written for my Grade 11 Computer Science class. It is ridiculously overengineered for Grade 11 Computer Science class,
making heavy use of OOP for most of the game's components.

Thanks to requirements, instructions on how to play should be self-evident once you start the game.

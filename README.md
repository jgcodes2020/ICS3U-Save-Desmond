# "Save Desmond"

This game was written for my Grade 11 Computer Science class. It is ridiculously overengineered for Grade 11 Computer Science class,
making heavy use of OOP for most of the game's components.

Thanks to requirements, instructions on how to play should be self-evident once you start the game. Also thanks to requirements,
all 2971 lines of game code are in the same file. (***thanks, Mr. K***).

## Running instructions

The code should be copy-pastable directly into any IDE. On Unix-based systems with a proper version of Java, you should be able to use
the provided shell script. Code was tested with Java 8, but should work on later versions.
